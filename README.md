go-dockertest-example

This repository was created to help people looking for ways to handle integration tests using `ORY - Dockertest` library

Basically this project spins up some containers using docker to simulate the integrations it need to work properly.

Currently we are running containers for:
    - Postgres

Examples that will be added in the future: 
    - AWS SQS
    - RabbitMQ
